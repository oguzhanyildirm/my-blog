**Why do we have blogs?**

**It’s a form of diary.**

I am unexperienced software developer and i believe my curiosity on software
will never end with this blog i will keep track of my way.

**It allows potential for self growth..**

So as you expect i have lots of things to experience and you know what people say

“If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.”

― Albert Einstein


**You’ll gain confidence.**

We have people around us and some of them valuable to us. If they have good attetion on your posts you will gain confidence.

**The blogging community is great.**

I am realistic man so lets be honest nobody going to read my blog until i start writing really good stuff and become a famous software developer.
I believe someday i will be that developer.

**It gives people a creative outlet.**

We all need creativity. I have day-to-day responsibilities and this blog will be one of them to push me to create  something meaningful.

This ideas on my mind for a long time so i made this blog and i will continue to contribute.

Have a good day.
